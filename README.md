CaseStudy/Final Project for PerScholas Java Application Development Class


There are numerous small non-profit groups and organizations that step up to help others in home repair and disaster relief.  I was inspired by organizations that build ramps for individuals in need.  
This website was designed to meet the requirements of Ozark Mission Project, a non-profit organization.  Ozark Mission Project operates camps and workshops in various locations in Arkansas.  They store tools in trailers.  This project focuses on managing information and inventory about individual tools and trailers.  This project could also be expanded to include client application management.  
The idea behind this project is that it could be expanded or changed based on the organization.
This project was created using the following:
Java, JPA, Spring Boot, Spring Security, HTML, CSS, Thymeleaf, SQL, and MariaDB.

The database must have some information loaded at set up.  I have created sql files with data for the trailers and base tool lists.  After these have been loaded then the trailers inventory can be loaded through the webpage. 

This project started with an idea, and User Stories were created. It changed after consulting with Ozark Mission Project.
